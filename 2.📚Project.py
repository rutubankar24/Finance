st.text('''The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not.
This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the >50K group or <=50K group''') 
st.title("ðŸ”¹Problem Solution:")
st.text('''Machine learning can help businesses improve products or speed up manual and time-consuming processes.
Managing an increasing number of online customer interactions has become a pain point for most businesses.
The concept of demand forecasting is used in multiple industries, from retail and e-commerce to manufacturing and transportation.
In this project, we are going to predict whether a person's income is above 50k or below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation ''')

st.title("ðŸ”¹Motivation:")
st.text('''Building such predictive models can help us better understand the population of a country as well as the various factors affecting the growth in the economy.
Governments can understand such factors and improve upon them leading to the growth of the country.''')
st.title("ðŸ”¹Conclusion:")
st.text('''Accuracy of this application is good and it will predict 85-90% accurate results.
In this project, we build various models like logistic regression, knn classifier, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier and xgboost classifier.
A hyperparameter tuned random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy score of 92.77 and f1 score of 93.08.''')
